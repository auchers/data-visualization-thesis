    "\n",
    "1. One is to take a very abstract conceptual approach with NY infrastructure merely as a use case for trying to explore conceptual metaphor in visual and mental representations. This would focus on the nature of topics and how we transition between different visual modalities and how to build those in the clearest way while maintaining connection to the grounded concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The other option is to make this thesis about the history of NY infrastructure -- promoting the subject matter to the front and treating it as the topic in its own right and not a vehicle for exploring something else. This I think has the potential to be more meaningful for a user, but also requires more domain knowledge that I am a bit unclear about whether I will be able to acquire in time for this thesis. I also don't know how to full spell this out -- would it be about patterns of development in the history of NY buildings, or something more akin to a historic survey of zoning and the effects on subsequent building. \n",

    "> The goal of this project is to explore the built infrastructure of New York City from the perspective of the periods and patterns of development that formed the landscape we know and live in today. As such, the subject matter for this thesis will be data representing contemporary NYC buildings. Being a Data Visualization Masters thesis, this project will also be concerned heavily with *representations of this data as a secondary explicit subject matter*. To that effect, this thesis will be exploring how to best communicate different trends in Urbanism from spatial, temporal, aggregative (both discrete and continuous), and particular instance level views. Specifically, throughout these representational explorations, there will arise questions of which types of representations are better suited for which types of information. This thesis will consist of revisiting the same data set from a variety of angles as such will hone in on which questions arise at each representational stage as well as how to best address them."
